            Cocogoat Cafe is a pop-up cafe based on the game Genshin Impact. (see video) We serve dishes and drinks that can be found in game! We have multiple
            branches across Teyvat, and more to come in every region! Affordable prices, beautiful presentation, and great, tasty food, served for you by our cooks.
            Our cute little cafe, run by our resident Qilin, Ganyu, is the best cafe* in all of Teyvat. With a simple concept of uniting cuisine from all regions,
            having a wide array in our menu promotes diversity and discovering new cuisines and ingredients.

        *note: we are the only cafe in Teyvat, thus making us best by default. this is not indicative of quality.
